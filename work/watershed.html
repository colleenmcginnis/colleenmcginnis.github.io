This interdisciplinary studio brought design students, science students, and education students together to design a watershed education center. As both a design and science student I was tasked with both designing the building and the content for displays. This allowed me to take a more holistic approach to sustainable design - first researching the experiential and biophysical characteristics of the site, and then applying that knowledge to the aesthetic and functional design of the structure itself.</p>
