<p><strong>Project Overview:</strong> As a response to the many trees lost to drought, the City of Austin developed a new initiative to use reclaimed water to nourish existing trees and establish new ones in city parks. This graphic, developed for the Public Interest Design Program at the University of Texas, is meant to communicate the proposed process to local residents and other important stakeholders. </p>
