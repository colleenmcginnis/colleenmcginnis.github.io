            <p><strong>Project Overview: </strong>This research project involved the assessment of the environmental, economic, and social impacts of <em>proxy</em>, a public project, on the surrounding community. </p> <p>When an earthquake damaged San Francisco’s Central Freeway and left a series of abandoned lots in the Hayes Valley neighborhood, local residents banded together to demand temporary solutions to activate the unused lots. Envelope A+D entered the picture with their concept for a collection of retail and food vendors in temporary structures made of shipping containers called <em>proxy</em>. <em>proxy</em> has been one in a series of initiatives that has significantly changed the nature of the neighborhood over the last ten years.</p>

            <p><strong>Research Methods: </strong>For several weeks we observed site users and documented visits, interactions, and activities through photography and on-site surveys. We also conducted interviews with various stakeholders to determine their involvement, intentions, and receptions of the project.</p>

            <p><strong>Content Machine: </strong>The architect described <i>proxy</i> as a 'content machine,' which refers to its experimental nature. <i>proxy</i> allows the necessary flexibility for vendors to test low fidelity products and services, refine them, and ultimately integrate them into permanent additions at vendors' brick and mortar locations.</p>
