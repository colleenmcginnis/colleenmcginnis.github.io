            <p><strong>Adaptability: </strong>The design took inspiration from both the natural and commercial characteristics of the lakefront by supporting adaptability. The kiosk is designed to maximize productivity regardless of where it is located along the lakefront. Its modular design allows for over 80 configurations that respond to the specific conditions of the immediate site. Configuration decisions can be made based on footprint constraints, pedestrian traffic, solar orientation, and the framing of lake or city views.</p>
