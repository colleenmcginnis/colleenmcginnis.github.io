      <div class="col-md-4" style="padding-top:10px"><p><strong>Research:</strong> A full semester of research was focused on understanding existing conditions of the schools and the surrounding neighborhood. Findings included a strong arts community, rich cultural diversity among students, and a historical lack of connectivity between the two neighborhood schools. </p></div>

      <div class="col-md-4" style="padding-top:10px"><p><strong>Process:</strong> Although many options were explored, our team focused on an experiment using a temporary art installation to reimagine the outdoor space that currently divides the two schools.</p></div>

      <div class="col-md-4" style="padding-top:10px"><p><strong>Installation:</strong> The temporary installation was completed over several months beginning with students making flags to be hung between the two schools and culminating in a two-day event that included closing down the street that divides the two schools and creating a physical connection between the schools using temporary paint on the street and sidewalks. The temporary street takeover challenged students, staff, parents, and other community members to reimagine the street as a space for students and as a connecting element between the schools. </p></div>
